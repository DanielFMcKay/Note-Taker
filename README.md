### This is placeholder, as this is very much a work in progress!!

## Live Site: https://notetaker-express-js.herokuapp.com/

I'm not gonna pretend this is finished, just that it exists now.

## Overview

This assignment is to modify starter code ot make a note taking app that can be used to write and save notes and store them in Express.js on the back end, retrieving them in a JSON file.




## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I get stuck and run into problems when making this site or simply need activation energy
THEN I work on the CSS to make it very, very pretty so I feel like I'm accomplishing something
```
